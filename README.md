## React Notes Keeper

React Notes Keeper is a simple web application built with React and Hooks that allows users to create and delete notes. It provides a convenient and intuitive interface for managing personal notes and reminders.

### Features

- **Add Note:** Users can easily add a new note by entering the title and content of the note in the designated fields. Clicking the "Add" button creates a new note and appends it to the list of existing notes.
- **Delete Note:** Each note displayed in the list has a delete button associated with it. Clicking the delete button removes the corresponding note from the list.

### Technologies Used

- React: The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture and efficient virtual DOM make it ideal for creating interactive web applications.
- Hooks: React Hooks are used to manage state and lifecycle within functional components, enabling the implementation of stateful logic without the need for class components.
- CSS: Styling is implemented using CSS to create an appealing and user-friendly interface.
